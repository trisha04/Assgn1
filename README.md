 
  G)Yes we can overload method with same return type but the argument list should be diffrent. If it is the case that arguments are same as that of the other then aleast the sequence of the arguments should be changed.
  Method Overloading means to have two or more methods with same name in the same class with different arguments. The benefit of method overloading is that it allows you to implement methods that support the same semantic operation but differ by argument number or type.

Important Points

Overloaded methods 
MUST change the argument list
CAN change the return type
CAN change the access modifier
CAN declare new or broader checked exceptions
A method can be overloaded in the same class or in a subclass
